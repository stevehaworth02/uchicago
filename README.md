# University of Chicago Mini-Experiment

[2-page Supplement from application portal](https://github.com/stevehaworth02/uchicago/blob/main/SupplementPDF/CodeSupplement_NoStatisticalTest.pdf)

5-page FULL Workflow

Hello University of Chicago MS-ADS Committee, thank you for visiting my GitHub page for my mini-experiment.

I LOVE the embedded boxplot/violin plot that I made for my coding supplement because the plot created is SO statistically rich.

However, in order for the statistics to be meaningful we must carefully pick the arguments of ggbetweenstats() based on the assumptions of our data.

In this repository, I justify the arguments I set forth in my coding supplement, I hope you enjoy inspecting my code as much as I loved writing it.

## For sake of your time, I've put all figures below, the full statistical work-flow is in uchicago > SupplementPDF > SupplementSubmission_FULL.pdf

Here is the photo summary of my work, find the full code in the SupplementSubmission_FULL.pdf
