# University of Chicago Mini-Experiment
Hello University of Chicago MS-ADS Committee, thank you for visiting my GitHub page for my mini-experiment.

I LOVE the embedded boxplot/violin plot that I made for my coding supplement because the plot created is SO statistically rich.

However, in order for the statistics to be meaningful we must carefully pick the arguments of ggbetweenstats() based on the assumptions of our data.
